## Synopsis

This is my submission for the chitter challenge. User can signup, log in and out. Anybody can see all public peeps on the index page. Only logged in users can post peeps. Also, users can send private peeps to other users, and these won't be visible on the main feed.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby, DataMapper, PSQL
- Styled using HTML and Bootstrap CSS
- Sinatra Web Framework
- Tested using RSpec and Capybara

## How to run

To run locally:
  * Clone and run bundle install
  * Run rackup
  * Visit localhost://9292 in the browser
  * Run RSpec for testing

Alternatively it is available on heroku:
